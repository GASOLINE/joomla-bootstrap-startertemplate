# Joomla Bootstrap4 startertemplate
A light, powerfull and free template for Joomla!â„¢ for faster and easier web development. I used https://blank.rocks as basis. The BL4NK template is **very good** and I use it for many projects. However I needed a setup with some items already added like in my scss files for even more faster development. I'll use this for my projects.
